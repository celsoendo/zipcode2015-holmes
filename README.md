##About
Our product allow home buyers to search for nearby listings using their smartphone.

Instead of a conventional search where you fill tons of fields in a form, you just open the app when you are in a neighborhood that you like and we will show you all nearby listings with augmented reality in your camera. 

If you choose one of the listings, you'll see all the details of the listing and you can call the agent right away.

## To use
- Fork/Clone this repo onto your desktop
- Open iOS-app/Holmes/Holmes.xcodeproj in XCode-7.1
- Compile!
- Note: This App is optimized for iPhone 6! :)
